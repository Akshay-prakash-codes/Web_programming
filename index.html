<h2>Text Formatting:</h2>
<p>The <b>quick brown fox</b> jumped over the <big>lazy dog</big>. It was a moment of <em>great excitement</em> 
as the fox displayed its <i>agility</i>. Meanwhile, the dog, much <small>smaller in stature</small>, showed <strong>resilience</strong>.
 The event was noted in the <sub>local history</sub> book, with a <sup>remark</sup> about the fox's incredible leap. 
 In the final version of the book, the editor <ins>added this description</ins> but later <del>removed an incorrect detail</del>.</p>

 <h2>Charcter Entities:</h2>
<p> To display certain characters properly in HTML, you need to use entities. For example, use &lt; for less than (<) and &gt; for greater than (>). 
 If you want to include an ampersand (&), write it as &amp;. Quotation marks (") and apostrophes (') can be written as &quot; and &apos;, respectively.
 For a non-breaking space, use &nbsp;, and for a hyphen (-), use &hyphen;. These entities ensure your text displays exactly as intended.</p>
 <hr>
 
<h2>Unordered Lists:</h2>
<p>There are several key features of HTML that make it essential for web development:
<ul> <li>It provides the basic structure of web pages.</li> <li>It allows embedding multimedia such as images and videos.</li> <li>
It supports links to navigate between different pages.</li> </ul> These features, along with its simplicity, make HTML a fundamental skill for aspiring web developers.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Ordered Lists:</h2>
<p><ol> <li>Start with the `&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;` declaration to define the document type.
</li> <li>Create the `&lt;html&gt;` element to contain the entire content.</li> <li>Add a `&lt;head&gt;` section for metadata and a `&lt;title&gt;` for the page title.
</li> <li>Include a `&lt;body&gt;` section for the main content of the page.</li> </ol> By following these steps, you can create a well-structured HTML document.</p>
